####### data_prep #######

preprocessing .h5ad file:
include the following obs ->
cell_ontology_class (MOST IMPORTANT: CELL TYPES)
organ_tissue
compartment
anatomical_information

See COVID_data.ipynb for example


####### data_prep #######
Update data_config to point to h5ad file in data/raw

Run presave_compartments.py in data_prep/ to create tissue ontology

Run script_0.constructPPI_rank.sh in scripts --- Creates ranked_genes.csv and .h5ad 
Run script_0.constructPPI_extract.sh in scripts --- Creates a .txt file for each cell type and .csv for a summary
